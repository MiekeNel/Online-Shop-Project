# Online-Shopping-App-Project

For this application, I built an online shopping page where the items are displayed to the user.
The user can select an item, and will then be given the stores in which this item is available.

The user is then prompted to select a store and reserve that item. In order to select an item, the user is required to login. If the user selects an item while being logged out, the user will be redirected to the login page.
