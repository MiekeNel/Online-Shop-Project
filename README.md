# Online-Shop-Project

## Project Description:
This project aimed to create an online shopping platform for a mock store. 
The website displays the online stores available items with images and prices. It allows the user to select an item, view the physical stores that has this specific item in stock, and allows the user to reserve their item until pick-up. The website requires the user to be logged in, and will therefore redirect to the login page as required.
